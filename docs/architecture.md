# Architecture

`components.js` introduces a block-definition registry and explicitly registered editing operations for widgets, groups and preset insertion. Existing editing operations retain their current fallback; duplicate new registrations fail at startup. Components reuse safe AST blocks and optional design group identities. Browser-local presets contain independent node/media/style snapshots; media is embedded for library transfer and remapped to fresh paths on insertion. The library never enters project history, while inserted content uses the normal validated transaction/checkpoint pipeline. See [component scope and manual review](blocks-components.md).

`authoring-definitions.js` shares widget fields with Library registration and generates the portable capability catalog. `authoring-contract.js` derives schema validation; `authoring-layouts.js` stages a detached native project using the same state handlers as Library insertion, without applying a live transaction. `authoring-review.js` renders inert candidate previews, measures fit without binding live media/selections and offers undoable post-import reflow. Unknown capabilities are errors and incompatible compositions produce explicit fallbacks. See [native AI authoring](ai-layouts-and-elements.md).

The versioned [local editing API](editing-api.md) stages supported metadata, template creation and existing-media placement operations on a detached candidate. UI controls reuse its validation/model helpers, while atomic batches enforce revision checks, existing design locks, one undo step and a pre-change checkpoint. It is local authoring code, not a remote or authenticated endpoint.

The repository is the source of truth for the studio engine and included examples. Each build inlines the source, styles, template bootstrap, and vendored JSZip into portable HTML. The application makes no required runtime CDN requests and has no server-side persistence.

`build.config.json` defines concatenation order. Runtime files share one IIFE scope: they are ordered source fragments, not independently importable ES modules. `projects.js` adds the project picker and compact menus after the existing controls are initialized. It serializes browser saves, verifies media completeness, reads recent records from IndexedDB, and protects same-ID file replacements with a separate previous-version copy. It mounts existing buttons into native details menus, preserving their handlers and shortcuts.

`experience.js` extends schema-v2 validation with branding and transition defaults while retaining older project imports. It also implements wizard UI, browser-local preset transfer, and a single cancellable transition owner. The build validates the assembled JavaScript before writing output. Keep the prelude first and boot last.

## Template boundary

The main distribution uses `templates/studio/presentation.json` as its eight-slide starting project and `templates/studio/bootstrap.js` as an empty compatibility bootstrap. `templates/studio/runtime.js` loads the bundled demo image and provides the generic reset template. `templates/blank/presentation.json` supplies the one-slide starter. The demo image is encoded inside the standalone HTML and also included in editable ZIPs.

Only neutral templates are included. Legacy section keys remain importable, with question banks rebuilt from user-provided project data.

The build emits generic demo and blank HTML files. Generic wizard choices include Blank, Studio demo, Import, and the first Portfolio starter/finished example. Imported legacy product content receives an opened-project reset baseline; resetting it does not substitute the Studio demo. Earlier schema and database identifiers are accepted only by the import/migration adapter; newly written projects use neutral identifiers.

`layouts.js` registers composition/slot/image-bound/reading-order metadata independently from project themes. It reuses safe AST templates and existing Media Grid objects, including bounded divider geometry. The collection layout operation moves complete editable nodes, retains unmatched material, respects design locks and commits through the revision-checked editing API. Example factories create fresh IDs with an independent reset baseline; original example artwork is embedded alongside the core demo asset. No project schema change, external service or additional dependency is introduced.

## Themes and visual editing

`src/themes.json` defines six paired palettes. `themes.js` extends optional brand data with `themePalettes`, `colorScheme`, and `schemeBase`; existing brands without those fields retain their exact colors. Theme-only presets reuse the brand preset transport with `scope: theme`, and do not overwrite fonts or logo assignments. Named palettes are applied explicitly.

`blocks.js` maps existing AST node identities to transient DOM markers in the editor preview. Text input writes whitelisted inline nodes back into the current slide, using the existing debounced history and autosave pipeline. It preserves the focused editable DOM across background renders to retain the caret. Structural operations use normal project transactions. Table/side-panel values synchronize with direct edits.

Clipboard HTML is never inserted; pasted text becomes text nodes and line breaks. Formatting uses supported inline tags; text alignment is added to the existing safe-style validator. Preview markers, selections, contenteditable attributes, and toolbars are not serialized into slide trees. Interactive Preview mode rebinds existing controls and keeps videos muted.

## Project data

A project pack has `schemaVersion`, `kind`, `meta`, `playbackOnly`, `state`, `checkpoints`, and `history`. Schema version 2 uses `kind: presentation-studio-project`. The import-only adapter in `compat.js` accepts the earlier identifier and normalizes new exports. State contains slides, sections, section Trash, loops, branding, media assignments, and an optional blank-project starting baseline.

Slide trees are validated against allowed nodes and attributes; imported raw HTML and displayed commands are not executed. Sections and slides use stable IDs. Labels can change without breaking media references. Hidden sections and slides are filtered out of presentation and playback exports. At least one visible slide must remain in a visible section.

## Persistence

Portable authoring v1 uses `authoring-contract.js` as the shared schema/validation definition; its adapter emits existing schema-v2 project packs. `local-workspaces.js` handles bounded JSON/ZIP decoding, import review and portable editable ZIP downloads. Browser drafts remain independent recovery. Live filesystem access is deferred; the runtime does not access or delete the old workspace-handle database. See [scope and security](local-workspaces.md).

- In-memory state supports bounded undo/redo and checkpoints.
- IndexedDB stores browser recovery drafts and media blobs by project ID.
- Editable ZIP exports contain the durable structured state and referenced assets.
- Playback exports remove editor-facing recovery state and custom presenter notes.
- Git versions the engine, templates, and approved examples, not browser drafts.

The exporter captures the source document before runtime mutations. All runtime assets therefore need to be inline or explicitly packaged. Test export/reopen whenever changing shell markup or boot order.

## Build and release

`npm run build` creates the demo and blank HTML distributions. `npm run package` produces a ZIP with the demo and blank distributions, documentation, notices, and example files using fixed entry dates. Generated files are ignored by Git and published as Actions artifacts or release attachments.

The validation workflow runs structural and browser tests before uploading artifacts. The release workflow validates and packages a tag whose version matches `package.json`, then attaches the outputs to a draft GitHub release for review. No Pages deployment or database is configured.

## Media Focus

`focus.js` owns one transient focus state. It moves the existing media figure into a canvas-local dialog and returns it via a geometry placeholder. Atomic DOM moves are preferred; fallback moves preserve video time/play state. The overlay pauses slide advancement, restores playback state, traps focus, makes background controls inert, and cancels safely before navigation or rebuild. Image zoom/pan stays bounded. Optional `presentation.mediaFocus` settings (enabled, animation, captions, zoom) receive defaults through the existing settings validator; runtime geometry and overlay markup are never serialized. No camera/microphone permission is requested.

## Legacy imports and storage

`compat.js` contains two identifier-only aliases for earlier schema-v2 files and the earlier browser database. No product content is bundled. New files use `presentation-studio-project`; new recovery data uses `presentation-studio-editor-v1`. On browsers with IndexedDB enumeration, an empty new database receives an atomic copy of earlier projects and assets on first use. The earlier database is preserved. Browsers without enumeration can import an editable ZIP. Imports normalize the origin to imported and retain an independent reset baseline.

## Canvas and booth extensions

`canvas.js` validates optional normalized placement/crop/lock data and per-slide media object lists. Existing primary assignments remain unchanged. Preview pointer gestures update transient DOM and commit a single model transaction on release. Lock checks reject protected model/media/section differences before history commits; explicit unlock actions are separate. Media objects reuse the existing asset/reference and Media Focus paths.

`booth.js` guards entry points and captures browser interactions while locked, persists salted passphrase verifiers and options, saves complete drafts before activation, and restores them on refresh. `booth-player.js` is a separately serializable playback runtime. Booth ZIPs build a minimal payload from selected visible slides and referenced assets rather than using the authoring source template. Its HTML has no editor or full project/recovery data. Local verifiers are a casual-tampering deterrent, not a security boundary against browser/OS control.

## Editor workspace

`workspace.js` rearranges existing authoring controls into a center canvas, right inspector and a project settings dialog while preserving their IDs and handlers. It observes selection and form refresh separately so a model update does not reset the selected inspector context. The text-session blur guard permits font controls to retain their target. Zoom scales only the outer editor preview; media gestures still normalize physical pointer coordinates against slide bounds. View state remains in memory and is excluded from the model and exports.

Sidebar thumbnails lazily clone current slide DOM, remove interactive controls and IDs, replace videos with static posters/placeholders, and are inert. Generation-scoped IntersectionObservers are disconnected when the list changes. Reordering uses stable slide IDs and the existing undo/change path, with section, search, booth and design-lock guards. Legacy navigation tests use the shared selectTab helper to enter the new project settings dialog.
