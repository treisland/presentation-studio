# Roadmap

## Current delivery plan

Public releases currently use the 0.1.x-alpha series. See [release stages and contribution flow](release-process.md). GitHub milestones and linked issues hold acceptance criteria and delivery state; this document summarizes direction.

- **Now — 0.1.4-alpha:** align Apache 2.0 licensing; establish contribution rules, required checks, automatic merging, and explicitly planned releases.
- **Next — 0.2.0:** presentation preflight, media reliability, backup verification, and keyboard/accessibility validation. Deliver alpha.N increments, freeze scope for beta, then RC and stable after documented gates.
- **Later — canvas enhancements:** screen-adaptive workspace, collapsible/resizable panels, additive media beside existing content, draggable blocks, snapping/layering and keyboard placement. Track separately under 0.3.0 unless deliberately promoted into 0.2 during alpha. Live timers/counters follow basic blocks.
- **Deferred:** camera overlays, template publishing, accounts and collaboration until the core workflow is dependable.

Track delivery in the [0.2.0 milestone](https://github.com/treisland/presentation-studio/milestone/1) and [0.3.0 milestone](https://github.com/treisland/presentation-studio/milestone/2).
